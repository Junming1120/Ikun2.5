 * __乌云在我们心里搁下一块阴影
我聆听沉寂已久的心情
清晰透明
就像美丽的风景
总在回忆里才看得清__.

 * __被伤透的心能不能够继续爱我
我用力牵起没温度的双手
过往温柔
已经被时间上锁
只剩挥散不去的难过__.

 * __缓缓飘落的枫叶像思念
我点燃烛光温暖岁末的秋天
极光掠夺天边
北风掠过想你的容颜
我把爱烧成了落叶
却换不回熟悉的那张脸__.

 * __缓缓飘落的枫叶像思念
为何挽回要赶在冬天来之前
爱你穿越时间
两行来自秋末的眼泪
让爱渗透了地面
我要的只是你在我身边__.

 * __被伤透的心能不能够继续爱我
我用力牵起没温度的双手
过往温柔
已经被时间上锁
只剩挥散不去的难过__.

 * __在山腰间飘逸的红雨
随著北风凋零
我轻轻摇曳风铃
想唤醒被遗弃的爱情
雪花已铺满了地
深怕窗外枫叶已结成冰__.

###  <ins>Maple</ins>
  * _The dark cloud places a piece of shadow in our hearts
I listen respectfully to my mood, which has already been quiet for a long time
Clear and transparent
Just like the beautiful scenery
It's always only clear when seeing it in my memory_.

 * _Can the heart, that has been thoroughly hurt, still continue to love me?
I make an effort to pull up the pair of hands that have no warmth
The tenderness in the past has already been locked by time
Only leaving sadness that doesn't go away
The maple leaves slowly falling down are like thoughts
I light a candle to warm up the end of autumn
The northern lights plunder the edge of the sky
The northern wind brushes past the expressions of missing you
I take love and burn it into fallen leaves
Yet I can't get back that familiar face_.


 * _The maple leaves slowly falling down are like thoughts
Why must retrieving be hurried before winter comes?
Loving you passing through time
Two rows of tears from the end of autumn
Let love permeate through the ground
All I want is you to be by my side_.

 * _The graceful red rain in between the mountainside
Withering with the north wind
I lightly swing the wind chimes
I want
To awaken the love that has been deserted
Snowflakes are already spread all over the ground
Deeply scared that the maple leaves outside the window have already become frozen_.
